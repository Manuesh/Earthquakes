# Earthquakes
This app has been developed for a university project, is a **native app for Android**.  
As the name says is an app to **track earthquakes** around Italy and is in fact very simple.

## So what has to offer this app?

1) A homepage with a list of recent earthquakes and a searchbar;
2) A map showing earthquakes through marks;
3) A simple detail page for earthquakes.

## Compatibility
Well the app has been developed for Android 8.0 Oreo (API 26) or newer but since I used Material Design 3
to build a dynamic theme for the app, I recommend using at least Android 10.
